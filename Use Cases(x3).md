People expected to use the following:

An additional feature we plan on offering to ensure that our application stands out from the rest is to provide happy hour information on the bars, drink specials, and any special events they have going on throughout the week. We can get this information from the bar owners themselves, or people visiting the bars. 

We will plan on using this feedback to improve our application and provide the public with the most user friendly application that provides them all the information they need when it comes to Omaha bars. 

We will provide users with coupons for drink specials at certain locations. People always love a deal so this could be a good way of getting people to use your application. We can work a deal out with the bars where we provide them with  free advertisement on our application, and in return they offer some dree drink specials to get users to come to their bar. To use the coupons the users must show proof of a coupon code from our application when they purchase a drink . This way the bar knows they are getting a return on their investment since we are getting customers to visit their bar through our service
