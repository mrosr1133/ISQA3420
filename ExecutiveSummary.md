  The system is designed to explain the working of open source software which keeps
database policies and if the incoming requests are according to the existing policies, then this
open source system issues a license against these requests. As this software is open source,
the system design shows that the developer can upload policy database but, it is added in the 
policy database and made available to target market only after the review by the manager. 
Facilitation of developers and clients is the main motivation behind the system design 
without compromising on the simplicity and easy understanding of software. The system 
helps developers in not only getting the licence for their software but, also in knowing 
the vulnerabilities associated with the software.


  Some changes in the system design can be introduced to speed up the process of policy
review, policy uploading and licensing. If the developer is made autonomous in getting
the licence, then the system might exclude the need for manager to review policy.
However, the existing structure seems more efficient because it involves a double check on 
the policy.There are some potential open source communities that might take interest in 
supporting the project for example the university researchers and developer associations that
like to project the vulnerability associated with their projects and software.The communities
of junior developers might light to support these open source software projects and offer
testing services, while the senior developer communities can offer financial and technical
support too. Legal communities might also be interested because they are interested in
discouraging unlicensed software and tend to project licensing bodies and software.
